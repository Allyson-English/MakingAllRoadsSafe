          <div id="panel">Like many others, the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic has filled me with more questions than answers. As I connected with friends, colleagues and family, I was struck by how different people's reactions were: some discussions I had were characterized by fear of the unknown, others were optimistic that this crisis would end quickly, and some were weary about what life would be like in the aftermath of quarantine. As I processed these changes, I was curious about whether there were broader trends in the public repsonse that could be discernable from online platforms. To answer this question, I chose to examine the Reddit 'Coronavirus' page. Using the <b>nltk library</b> in Python, I built a data pipeline to evaluate online sentiment related to COVID-19 over time.<br/> 

            <div id="2ad491f7-edf1-4c30-9df6-c2818d2697d6" class="plotly-graph-div" style="height:600px; width:1300px;"></div>

          <br/><b>What I learned:</b><br/><br/>
          While this process showed me a bit about how people are reacting to COVID-19, it taught me more about sentiment analysis, including the strengths and weaknesses of various models. It also made me eager to learn more about training my own model. Through random spot checks, I found that the model I was using wasn't always accurate and that capturing the nuance of speech is incredibly challenging (it's one thing to characterize all instances of the statement "I hope" but another challenge entirely to pick up on comments that convey the essence of hopefulness).

          <br/><br/><b>Next Steps:</b><br/><br/>
          My next step is to evaluate the rate of false negative and false positives. I'm excited to continue updating the current analysis and expand this research to include sentiment from city-specific Reddit communities. I'm also eager to explore other sentiment analysis libraries to compare results. Learning about different methodologies for sentiment analysis models will help me figure out the various strengths and weakness and, hopefully, help me learn how I might train my own model.

        <div id="panel1">Access to essential services is a pervasive barrier in much of the world. In your own life, think about how important it is to be able to travel to work, get to the doctors office when you need it, or stop by a grocery store. For much of the world's urban populations, poor public transit infrastructure, congested roadways, and unsafe walking conditions make it difficult for many people to access what they need. Autonomous vehicle technology (AVT) has the potential to revoluationize the way we think about travel and is becoming normalized in many of the worlds prosperous countries. And yet, little research exists examining the potential impact of these technologies in low- and middle-income countries.<br/><br/>

        Working with a professional mentor to evaluate the economic impact of AVT adoption in Nairobi, Kenya, I developed a Python tool that utilizes Uber Movement and Open Street Map data to evaluate the magnitude of congestion along most-traveled Nairobi roadways. As you can see from the plots below, on each of the major roadways in Nairobi, traveling speeds during morning and evening commuting hours is significantly lower than free-flow speeds (speeds recorded in the absence of traffic or adverse weather conditions) on the same roads.<br/><br/> 

        <div id="98203b97-5021-4f43-9627-bdaf682028b4" class="plotly-graph-div" style="height:400px; width:1000px; content: center;"></div>

        <b>What I learned:</b><br/><br/>
        The majority of roadway-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, so AVT has the greatest transformative potential in these contexts. And yet, I found that only a fragment of AVT research explores the impact of this technology outside of the world's leading economies. I was curious about evaluating economic impact from a range of perspectives: the opportunity cost, in dollars, of sitting in traffic; the negative environmental effects of congestion; the excess expenses for car owners due to vehicle wear and tear; and disability adjusted life years for injuries that occur as a result of heavy traffic (especially in a city like Nairobi, where it's common to see people walking alongside busy streets). This proved to be a bit of a challenge and required prioritization of areas that were most amenable to analysis (where data already existed). More learnings are documented in the 'ReadMe' file associated with this analysis on GitHub. 

       <br/><br/><b>Next Steps:</b><br/><br/>
       The final draft of this paper is still a work in progress (but you can check out the code I used to scrape and visualize the data here). I plan to update this space with a link to the article once it has been finalized.

          Globally, there is growing agreement that primary health care (PHC), with its ability to address up to 90 percent of a population’s diverse health needs, is central to the achievement of UHC. As a member of the Joint Learning Network for Universal Health Coverage (JLN) Primary Health Care Technical Initiative, I worked with policymakers, health system managers, and frontline providers from 15 countries to develop practical guidelance on how PHC data can be used more effectively to drive improvements in quality and delivery of care. This work emphasized 'difficult-to-measure' areas of PHC, such as service delivery, patient satisfaction, and provider motivation. The output of this two-year engagement was a toolkit-- still used today by the JLN and its nearly 30 member countries-- offering actionable guidance, tips from implementers, and real-world examples to help guide other country's on their own journies to UHC.<br/><br/>

          <b>What I learned:</b><br/><br/>
          The majority of knowledge synthesized in this toolkit was collected from health system experts across 14 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. While conducting the research that informed this toolkit, I was struck by the variability in measurement challenges across contexts: a barrier in one country may be an opportunity in another. And, likewise, the solutions that work so well in one country can be completely wrong for that country's peers. This realization underscores the importance of data culture and illustrates that the collection of high-quality information is only part of the journey. The way that information is used, communicated and translated into action, is the cornerstone to data-driven improvements.

        <div id="panel3">As a technical facilitator for the Joint Learning Network for Universal Health Coverage (JLN), I have the opportunity to engage with policymakers and technical experts from around the world to explore how countries are working to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Leaving these convenings, I often found myself wishing that I could capture and share the robust discussion, debate and shared learning that took place. This led me to propose, design and develop a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/07csoi4DBTOzBApkT9BgGg">podcast mini-series</a>, highlighting the experiences and reflections of countries and global experts on their journies to achieve UHC.<br/><br/>

         <b>What I Learned:</b><br/><br/>
        Creating a product for an audience is all about empathy. As the producer for this work, I spent much of time drafting scripts for our host and adivising our tech consultant which portions of interviews should be spliced together. This pushed me to think about the work from the perspective of our intended audience. Since completing this work, I've realized that an empathetic approach to design is needed in all projects, not only media. As I continue to develop my skills in programming, I'm eager to explore how I can use these principles of user-centered design in my work.<br/><br/>

        <b>Next Steps:</b><br/><br/>
        A follow-on series is currently underway. If you enjoy these podcasts, be sure to watch this space!

        <div id="panel4"><br/>The idea that primary health care is the foundation of strong, equitable health systems is not new. And yet, all too often, primary health care is the weakest link in a health system. Many countries have identified primary health care as an urgent priority, but don’t have the information they need to drive targeted improvements. Uncoordinated data systems that fail to combine local and national level inputs make it hard to see where primary health care is falling short, and the data that does exist is often of poor quality or difficult for governments and donors to understand and use. As a member of the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative, I led the development of seven case studies examining how data is being used to strengthen primary health care and accelerate progress towards universal health coverage across five countries.<br/><br/>

        <b>What I Learned:</b><br/><br/>
        I love talking to people about their passions, and the stakeholder interviews I conducted for this report allowed me to do just that. Translating what I heard into case studies that simultaneously depicted these innovations through the eyes of the innovators who implement them while conveying key take-aways for others was a unique challenge. I enjoyed the iterative writing process and, as the lead author for this work, enjoyed bringing a written piece from conceptualization through to publication.<br/><br/>
